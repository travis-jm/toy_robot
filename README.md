# toy-robot

URL: http://localhost:4200/board 

Simple toy robot application, with two input modes. 

Default Mode - indivdual commands that work in the background
Queue Mode - Queue a list of commands that execute in the order they were submitted.

The report command outputs the ultimate position, or if you still need to place the robot.

All testing was handled in the board.js controller unit test.
